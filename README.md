🎯Looking for interesting opportunities to work with Front End Development!

📚I'm currently learning new things about front-end development, like JavaScript, libraries and frameworks (REACT, Angular, JQuery), compilers (Saas and Less), Responsive design, etc.

💭"I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unceasing devotion to the things you want to see happen."

In my free time, like all good NERD🤓, I love movies (🎞️), series (📺), video games (🎮), books and HQ (📚), listening to music (🎶) and play the drums (🥁).
